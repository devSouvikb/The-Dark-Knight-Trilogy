# The Dark Knight Trilogy

Hey! Welcome to my Quiz Game "**The Dark Knight Trilogy**".

It's a JavaScript CLI app hosted on repl.it. I have build it while learning web dev with [neoGcamp](https://neog.camp/)

## Topic

This CLI game is based on Christopher Nolan's _Batman Begins_, _The Dark Knight_ and _The Dark Knight Rises_ collectively known as "**The Dark Knight Trilogy**"

**This game is divided into 3 different levels**.

- **Level 1** consist of 10 questions each carries 2 marks with no negative marking, the player has to score 12 or above to go to level 2.

- **Level 2** consist of 5 questions each carries 2 marks with -1 negative marking, the player has to give all level 2 answers correct to go to level 3.

- **Level 3** consist of 5 question each carries 4 marks and -2 negative marking.

I have used `readlineSync()` as a dependency to take user input and [CHALK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) to beautify the app.
